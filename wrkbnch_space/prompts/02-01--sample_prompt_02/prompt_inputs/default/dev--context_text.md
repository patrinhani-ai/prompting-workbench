# User Registration - Business Rules
**Description:**
As a prospective user, I want to register a new account by providing required personal information, so that I can access the application's features and functionalities.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] The user provides essential details, this is validated for completeness avoiding empty or malformed information.
- [ ] Email address is checked for uniqueness to prevent duplicate accounts. 
- [ ] Account creation automatically produces an associate notification and stores basic User data and other authentication data(password will have a strong Hash). (for scalability purpose, such events may also require  asynchronous implementations )
- [ ] A  success message is displayed once account signup was successful allowing this event to be audited for verification 

## **Business Rules**
- Rule 1: The registration requires name, email, and a secure password (at last 8 digits with capital and numbers combinations.). Password must match confirm password field.
- Rule 2: Email addresses must be unique. if there's a duplicate, the system informs you via notifications and clear information (such as visual messages) and let's you continue by trying use another E-Mail adress, correcting potential mistakes or recovering access. Password changes must be controlled (via rules and notification of potential security breaches, as low grade/ easily guessable passwords).
- Rule 3: Upon successful registration, basic security information might need update immediately by following up on a mail or similar, confirming account creation to avoid malicious bots spamming the system for mass signups.

## Assumptions
- Assumption 1: A database exists to store user information and other authentication related data safely under standards policies as well is a valid  authentication mechanisms..  
- Assumption 2:  Standard email system exists (for confirmations, notifications and security communications for users)

## Usability Considerations
- Consideration 1: Error feedback should be immediate,  clear, accurate,  related to correct filling(formating) issues in order and to help the user avoid duplicated effort as data field inputs may have dynamic validation based events(for better front-end UX).  Input fields have descriptive texts(label fields). Use of design system components helps consistent style ensuring uniformity. Avoid showing confusing UI responses in error conditions for more user trust through usability (by minimizing cognitive overloading issues).
- Consideration 2: Clear success and fail messages with consistent visual styles improve UI UX and are used.  Buttons (design system elements in visual representation may need to)  communicate clearly the expected activity action and the overall success once an event happened (such confirmation, email/user info updated in db and etcetera)
- Consideration 3: After register is displayed with good visual feedback signaling event success with proper links showing (or providing such  ability on request) detailed reports on what kind status user register success details are: that way its more easier audit such creation for further data inspection and/or more robust user experience. That process (including feedback mechanisms) also provide traceability towards all account creations made in accordance to GDPR regulation requirements(privacy issues handling).

## Extra Information
This user story covers the functionality related and required directly for standard user (Account manager related registration might have more fields such role details or account group info). Additional security features, further verification process like e-mail approval through e-mail may be integrated on top this for more complex systems/needs . This initial functionality can serve like foundational features for those.  The creation requires compliance towards international policies, regulations (related safety standards for users, in most markets: namely GDPR etc.) but for this initial development these constraints may assumed.  This model also implies that we are not handling User roles yet with it possible scalability(consider it as future phase of development); at later development phase , more complex scenarios / additional authentication logic can then be integrate or implement upon such existing initial business model, integrating different types user handling if a given application might have such  specific feature requirements (managers roles with enhanced  privilige  access; developers with other special authorizations .. et ).
